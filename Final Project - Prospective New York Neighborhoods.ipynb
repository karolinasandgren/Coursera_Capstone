Because of this, young professionals may opt for neighborhoods that have venues to work from other than their own home, such as coffee shops, libraries, etc.\n#### For this project, my target audience is young professionals who are interested in moving to New York City. More specifically, I am targeting young professionals who work virtually, and are looking for neighborhoods that have various options for coffee shops to work from when they may need a change of scenery from working from home.
